# Browser Vault


Browser Vault is a new web application design to minimize academic dishonesty in a remote learning setting. It locks down your browser, preventing students from using common keyboard and mouse shortcuts such as Alt + tab, Windows + arrow, or the Esc key. Browser Vault monitors your browser and sends analytics to the teacher.
