# Browser Vault

In a digital age, we rely on technology to help with facets of our everyday life.

In light of recent events, there has been a growing stress on the digital communications industry to replicate the everyday aspects of life we were familiar with prior to social distancing. In school that means teachers being able to administer classwork and tests without having to worry about academic dishonesty. Unfortunately, testing apps in the market currently do little to prevent students from cheating in a wide variety of ways, such as switching to different tabs or communicating with others for answers during tests. In order to protect the academic integrity of schools while they use virtual classrooms, we created a new application called Browser Vault. With Browser Vault, the studentâ€™s computer gets completely locked down, with them being unable to Alt-tab or open communication websites like Discord or Slack without losing access to the test.
